A webapp demo showcasing stock market prediction using natural language processing and machine learning

The methodology is based on the approach of [Lee et al., 2014](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/pubs/lrec2014_stocks.pdf). This machine learning-based predictive model uses numerical data from earnings per share surprise and text data from SEC 8K reports to make daily predictions on the market.
